Chameleon-Tiny
==============

This is a fork of the Chameleon-Mini repository to add Firmware support for the Chameleon-Tiny: multiple leds and UART mode (allows Bluetooth control via Android app).

The purpose is to track Chameleon-Mini upstream for this device, given the original firmware has been discontinued.
